## 1. 📋 Project Overview <a id="project-overview"></a>

This project focuses on creating a comprehensive, interactive Excel dashboard to analyze pizza sales data and provide actionable business insights. It uses advanced Excel tools (PivotTables, Slicers, custom charts) to transform raw transactional data, evaluate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and identify opportunities for enhancing sales, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. The goal is to empower stakeholders with data-driven strategies for inventory, marketing, and operations.

## 2. ❓ Problem Statement & Objectives <a id="problem-statement"></a>

The business faces challenges in optimizing performance due to:
* *Product Performance:* Inconsistent identification of best-sellers, leading to overstocking low-performing items and understocking popular options.
* *Sales Trends:* Lack of granular insights into seasonal, weekly, and hourly sales patterns, resulting in suboptimal staffing and ineffective marketing.
* *Decision-Making:* Absence of a centralized, dynamic tool, leading to reliance on static reports and reactive strategies.

*Project Objectives:*
1.  Transform raw sales data into actionable insights using advanced analytics and visualization tools.
2.  Develop an interactive Excel dashboard to monitor KPIs, track sales trends, and identify customer preferences.
3.  Empower stakeholders to make informed decisions, enhance inventory management, and optimize strategies.

## 3. 🛠 Methodology Summary <a id="methodology"></a>

The project follows a rigorous, step-by-step methodology for creating insightful Excel dashboards:

1.  *Data Import & Extraction:* Downloaded and loaded the Pizza Restaurant Sales dataset from Kaggle.
2.  *Data Familiarization:* Clarified project objectives (e.g., identifying peak sales hours, best-selling categories).
3.  *Data Cleaning & Formatting:* Removed duplicates, handled missing values, renamed the table, and ensured consistency in date, time, and currency formats.
4.  *Data Transformation:* Created new calculated columns: order_hour, order_day, and order_month using formulas like HOUR and TEXT.
5.  *KPI Definition:* Calculated essential metrics: *Total Sales, Average Order Value, Total Pizzas Sold, Total Orders, and Average Pizzas Per Order.*
6.  *Data Visualization & Analysis:* Created PivotTables, Bar Charts, Line Charts, and Doughnut Charts to analyze sales by hour, day, month, category, and size, including the Top 5 and Bottom 5 pizzas.
7.  *Dashboard Development:* Integrated all visual elements, KPIs, and interactive Slicers into a single, cohesive, user-friendly 'Dashboard' sheet.

## 5. 🔑 Key Findings (Compressed) <a id="key-findings"></a>

| Area | Key Finding | Insight & Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *KPIs* | Total Sales: $817,860, Total Orders: 21,350, AOV: $38, Pizzas/Order: 2.32. | Strong market demand and a preference for group/family purchases. *Action:* Implement upselling/bundling strategies (e.g., 'family meal deals'). |
| *Hourly Sales* | Peak Hours: 12 PM–2 PM (Lunch) and 6 PM–8 PM (Dinner). | These periods drive over 50% of revenue. *Action:* Optimize staffing and inventory to meet high demand; introduce 'Lunch Specials'. |
| *Day of Week* | Highest Revenue: Friday ($136,074). Lowest Revenue: Sunday ($99,203). | Weekend-driven demand is strong. *Action:* Use 'Weekend Feasts' to sustain momentum; offer discounts/bundles on Sundays to boost low traffic. |
| *Monthly Trend* | Highest Month: July ($74,000). Lowest Month: October ($58,000). | Sales exhibit a gradual post-summer decline. *Action:* Launch limited-time offers (LTOs) and festive campaigns during off-peak months. |
| *Category* | Classic: 27% (Top). Veggie: 24% (Bottom). | Traditional options dominate, but veggie options underperform. *Action:* Revamp veggie recipes with health-focused branding to tap into wellness trends. |
| *Top 5 Pizzas* | Dominated by Chicken-based options (Thai Chicken, Barbecue Chicken). | Strong demand for protein-rich, distinctive flavors. *Action:* Highlight best-sellers in campaigns; explore new variations of top-performing flavors. |
| *Bottom 5 Pizzas* | Dominated by Vegetarian options (Brie Carre, Green Garden). | Low resonance suggests a need for innovation. *Action:* Rebrand or bundle bottom-sellers with popular options to increase visibility. |
| *Pizza Size* | Large (L) is the most popular size. XXL sells only 28 units (Lowest). | Group-oriented orders dominate. *Action:* Prioritize inventory for Large/Medium sizes; phase out XXL or offer it as a limited-time special. |

## 6. 🚀 Conclusion and Recommendations <a id="conclusion-recommendations"></a>

The analysis confirms robust market demand but reveals clear opportunities for strategic optimization.

*Top Recommendations:*

1.  *Inventory & Operations:* Prioritize Large and Medium sizes; phase out XXL. Optimize staffing during peak lunch/dinner hours (12 PM–2 PM, 6 PM–8 PM).
2.  *Marketing & Product:* Promote best-selling Classic and Chicken pizzas. Revitalize underperforming Vegetarian pizzas with new, trendier ingredients and health-focused branding.
3.  *Sales Boost:* Introduce exclusive deals and family bundles on low-performing days (Sunday) and during slower months (October).
4.  *Data Strategy:* Address limitations by collecting customer demographics, multi-year data, and behavioral insights (e.g., CLV, satisfaction scores).

---

## 7. ⚠ Limitations <a id="limitations"></a>

The current analysis is limited by:
* *Timeframe:* Only a single year of data, limiting validation of long-term and seasonal trends.
* *Data Scope:* Lack of customer demographic data (age, location, income) hinders effective segmentation.
* *External Factors:* Absence of competitor pricing, weather conditions, or public holiday data may skew trend interpretations.
* *Behavioral Data:* Missing metrics on customer retention and satisfaction.
